### SOL's Verilog Cheatsheet for Not So Beginners

- For grammar, please go to [Grammar sheet](https://marceluda.github.io/rp_dummy/EEOF2018/Verilog_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)  
- Different views of verilog:
  - Behavioral
    - Describe how data flows/changes
    - Probably not synthesizable
    - Cannot help beginners understand the real composition of circuits
    - Can be optimized by synthesizer
    - Use it only when you are sure what you are constructing (or building simulation test bench)
  - Structural
    - Describe how circuits are formed (registers and combinational logics)
    - Good for beginners
    - Hard for complex designs (in this case, behavior model is allowed, you just need to know whant will be generated)
  - Maybe you should try some [fancy codegen or HLS](https://www.chisel-lang.org/)

- Wire connection:

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    always @ (*) begin
        a <= b;
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    assign a = b;
    ```

- Register connection:

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    reg a;
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        a <= b;
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    wire a;
    DFlipFlop dff(clk, a, b);
    ```
  - For the implementation of DFF please refer to your digital logic design textbook. In verilog, you need not (also should not) implement latches yourself.

- Multiplexer:

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    always @ (*) begin
        if (s) begin
            y <= exp1;
        end
        else begin
            y <= exp0;
        end  
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    // Use submodule
    Mux mux_asbc(y, s, exp0, exp1);
    
    // Use ?:
    assign y = s ? exp1 : exp0;
    
    // For vec input
    assign y = exp[s];
    ```

- Multilevel Multiplexer:

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    always @ (*) begin
        case (s):
            2'd0: y = exp0;
            2'd1: y = exp1;
            2'd2: y = exp2;
            2'd3: y = exp3;
        endcase
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    Mux mux_01(y01, s[0], exp0, exp1);
    Mux mux_23(y23, s[0], exp2, exp3);
    Mux mux_02(y  , s[1], y01 , y23);
    ```

- Prioritized Encoder:

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    integer i;
    
    always @ (*) begin
        for (i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) begin
            if (x[i])
                y <= i;
        end
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    genvar i;
    assign __y[0] = 0;  // __y is temporary
    assign y = __y[n];
    generate
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i = i + 1) begin
            __y[i] = x[i] ? i : __y[i-1];
        end
    endgenerate
    ```

- Moore State Machine

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        state <= some_behavioral_logic(state, in);
        out <= some_behavioral_logic(state, in);
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    assign next_state = some_combinational_logic(state, in);
    assign out = state;
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        state <= next_state;
    end
    ```

  - From here you can learn that sequential logic is only registers connected by combinational circuit.

- Mealy State Machine

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    assign out = some_behavioral_logic(state, in);
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        state <= some_behavioral_logic(state, in);
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    assign next_state = some_combinational_logic(state, in);
    assign out = next_state;
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        state <= next_state;
    end
    ```

- Async-negedge sync-posedge FF

  - Behavioral:

    ```verilog
    always @ (posedge clk or posedge start) begin
        if (start)
            ready <= 1'b0;
        else if (valid)
            ready <= 1'b1;
    end
    ```

  - Structural:

    ```verilog
    reg ready_ff;
    always @ (posedge clk) begin
        ready_ff <= next_ready_ff;
    end
    
    // When start, async reset ready
    assign ready = start ? 1'b0 : ready_ff;
    // Not started at this cycle
    // ready: already ready (idle)
    // valid: not ready now, but recieved valid now, so next cycle can be ready
    assign next_ready_ff = !start & (ready | valid);
    ```
